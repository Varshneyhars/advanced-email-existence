# Advanced Email Existence

**Advanced Email Existence** is a Node.js library that verifies whether an email address exists by querying the domain's mail exchange (MX) servers. It performs real-time verification by connecting to the SMTP server(s) of the email's domain and sending partial SMTP commands to validate the existence of the email address.

## Features

- **Email Format Validation:** Ensures the email is in a valid format (e.g., `name@domain.com`).
- **MX Record Lookup:** Resolves mail exchange (MX) records for the email domain.
- **SMTP Verification:** Connects to the domain's mail server and uses SMTP commands (`HELO`, `MAIL FROM`, `RCPT TO`) to verify the email.
- **Optimized for Speed:** Uses parallel MX resolution and optimized connection timeouts.
- **Customizable Timeout:** Allows setting a custom timeout for SMTP connections.

## Installation

Install the library using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install advanced-email-existence
```

or

```bash
yarn add advanced-email-existence
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s how you can use the `checkEmailExistence` function, supporting both ES Modules and CommonJS:

### ES Module Example

```javascript
import checkEmailExistence from 'advanced-email-existence';

(async () => {
    const result = await checkEmailExistence('test@example.com');
    console.log(result); // { valid: true/false, undetermined: true/false }
})();
```

### CommonJS Example

```javascript
const checkEmailExistence = require('advanced-email-existence');

(async () => {
    const result = await checkEmailExistence('test@example.com');
    console.log(result); // { valid: true/false, undetermined: true/false }
})();
```

### Parameters

- **`email` (string, required):** The email address to verify.
- **`timeout` (integer, optional):** The maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait for a response from the mail server. Default is `5000` milliseconds (5 seconds).
- **`fromEmail` (string, optional):** The email address to use for the `MAIL FROM` SMTP command. Defaults to the email being verified.

### Example with Custom Parameters

```javascript
const result = await checkEmailExistence('test@example.com', 10000, 'noreply@mydomain.com');
console.log(result); // { valid: true, undetermined: false }
```

### Response

The `checkEmailExistence` function returns a `Promise` that resolves to an object containing the following properties:

- **`valid` (boolean):** Indicates whether the email address is valid (i.e., the mail server accepted it).
- **`undetermined` (boolean):** Indicates whether the result is undetermined (i.e., the server did not respond conclusively).

### Example Response

```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "undetermined": false
}
```

### Error Handling

In case of DNS resolution failure, invalid email format, or when the mail servers return undetermined results, the function logs errors and returns appropriate feedback.

**Example error logging:**
```bash
DNS resolution failed: Error: queryMx ENOTFOUND domain.com
```

## Optimizations

- **Parallel MX Resolution:** MX records are resolved in parallel, and the first successful response is returned.
- **Connection Timeout:** The default timeout is 5000ms (5 seconds), configurable for faster or more lenient timeouts.
- **Port 25:** SMTP connections are made over port 25 to maintain compatibility with most mail servers.

## API

### `checkEmailExistence(email, timeout = 5000, fromEmail = email)`

- **`email`:** The email address to verify.
- **`timeout`:** (Optional) Timeout for the SMTP connection (in milliseconds). Default is `5000`.
- **`fromEmail`:** (Optional) The email address to use for the `MAIL FROM` command. Defaults to the email being checked.

Returns a `Promise` that resolves to an object `{ valid, undetermined }`.

### Example

```javascript
const result = await checkEmailExistence('hello@domain.com');
console.log(result);
// Output: { valid: true, undetermined: false }
```

### Return Values

- **`valid`:** `true` if the email address exists, otherwise `false`.
- **`undetermined`:** `true` if the result could not be conclusively determined.

## Common Use Cases

1. **Email Signup Validation:** Ensure users provide valid email addresses during signup or registration.
2. **Bulk Email List Validation:** Validate large lists of emails before sending out marketing campaigns.
3. **Database Cleansing:** Remove invalid emails from your user database.

## Limitations

- **SMTP Server Rate Limits:** Some email servers apply rate-limiting to SMTP commands, potentially causing undetermined results.
- **Privacy Settings:** Certain servers hide the existence of email addresses due to privacy/security policies.
- **False Positives:** Catch-all domains may accept all email addresses, resulting in possible false positives.
